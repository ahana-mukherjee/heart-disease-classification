## Predicting heart diesease using machine learning

This project looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in am attempt to build a machine learning models capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

### Problem Statement

Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predivt whether or not they have heart disease?

We are going to use Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib for data analysis and manipulation and Scikit-learn for modelling.
